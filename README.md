<b>Requirements for Database:</b><br />
Data Solutions had various business needs to be addressed in this database. To pinpoint these
needs we had to conduct interviews with all stakeholders, gather information from forms and
existing systems.<br />
A) Interviews:<br />
From this information we could determine what piece of information is needed to what
group and it leads us to create different procedures and views for this specific group.<br />
B) Business forms and documents:<br />
These were very important for our purpose of our database creation. We used number of
forms which is used by business every day. Some of the forms we used were<br />
1) New higher information form<br />
2) Invoices<br />
3) Sales Receipt<br />
4) Expenses Reports<br />
5) Customer Survey<br />
6) Timesheets<br />
7) Payroll details<br />
These forms sometimes contained redundant data and some of the information could be
combined together. Hence we created database with following details.<br /><br />
